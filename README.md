# Algorithms and Data Structures
Various algorithm implementations

# Knapsack Problem
* Solution uses dynamic programming approach
* Runtime: O(mn) where n is the number of items and m is the size of the knapsack

# Prim's Algorithm
Improved Prim's algorithm for finding minimum spanning tree
Runtime : O(V^2) where V is the number of vertices in the graph

# Kruskal's Algorithm 
Improved Kruskal's algorithm for finding minimum spanning tree
Runtime : O(E*logE) where E is the number of edges in the graph

#DNA Sequence Alignment Problem
*The solution employs dynamic programming approach
*There is a user defined gap and mismatch penalty ; goal is to align two DNA strings with minimum penalty incurred
*Runtime: O(ab) where a is the length of string1 and b is the length of string2
